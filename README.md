# Word Count (Python)

In this assignment you will use your knowledge of Python basic strings,
arithmetic, file reading, and dicts to create a command line utility to count
the words in a text file ([small.txt](./small.txt) and [alice.txt](./alice.txt)).

Implement the optional command line argument to print just the top 20 most frequent words in the file.

# Debugging
Use your VSCode IDE to debug and single-step your wordcount.py -- Create two debug launch.json configurations: One with optional top_20 argument (above) and one without.

3. Create a separate branch named `dev`, and checkout the branch.
5. Commit your changes, then `git push` the branch back to your own github account.
5. From your own Github repo, create a pull request (PR) from your `dev` branch back to your own master.
6. Copy/Paste the URL **link to your PR** as your assignment submission.
7. Your grader will post code review comments inline with your code, in your github account. Be sure to respond to any comments and make requested changes. **RESUBMIT** a new link to your PR after making changes.  This is the code review iteration cycle.
